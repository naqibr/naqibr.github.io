abstract: In this paper, preliminary design of an unmanned ground vehicle which can execute reconnaissance of caves is performed. The unmanned ground vehicle is preferred to be electric powered in order to provide silence during movement and make it difficult to be detected by thermal cameras. The unmanned system is designed as cable controlled since an autonomous system is not dependable during a clash. On board cameras helps the operator to obtain relevant data about the cave. The vehicle can drill and blast the cave wall and makes the cave unserviceable. The proposed system can reduce the casualties during the war on terrorism.
